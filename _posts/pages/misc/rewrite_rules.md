title: Style and Formatting
---

Animal Crossing Modding strives to be a good source of info about modding AC, as acceptable as possible, like a wiki. A problem noticed though is pages might not be the most aesthetically pleasing. So after taking inspiration from other wikis, there's a great effort to set some standards here. It's not set in stone, and it may be broken, though it won't be dismissed. 

# Formatting
## Punctuation

When quoting as a blockquote or dialog box, the literal will be recorded, including any errors. For example, Redd says this:

> Hello, and welcome aboard Jolly Redd's Treasure Trawler! How are ya? The name's Redd. I work in sales. And you are {PlayerName}!
What a great name! Intelligent. Strong. I can already tell we're gonna be pals. No, not pals, family! It's a pleasure to meet ya, {PlayerName}!

When quoting in-line, the text should be enclosed within `code`. Mistakes or incorrect grammar may be edited out, intentional or not, for the sake of better reading. For example, `Hello, and welcome aboard Jolly Redd's Treasure Trawler! How are you? The name's Redd. I work in sales. And you are {PlayerName}! What a great name! Intelligent. Strong. I can already tell we're going to be pals. No, not pals, family! It's a pleasure to meet you, {PlayerName}!`

Numbers should be avoided for their text forms. For example, "100 bells" should be corrected to, "One hundred bells." Exceptions to this are especially large numbers, listing crafting recipes, or listing the amount a stack of items holds.

## Perspective
Previously, there was a big use in writing in the first person. While there is a reason to it (to make the readers feel that the writer is going along with them), it will probably be removed and replaced to be in the second person.

## Emphasis
- **Bold** - Bold text should only be used to emphasize the name of the page's subject, the first time it appears on the page. Instead of using bold text to bring your attention to something important, the text will instead be in a larger font than the rest. Though, this is the rule that would probably be broken the most.
- *Italics* - Italics should be used for the names of items, or a quote. It may also be used to emphasize a sentence. For example, "You *are not* the father."
- CAPITALIZATION - Unless an item, character, building, quote etc. use all capital letters, all caps should not be used. Standard American English will still be used though, so if a proper noun is used then it will be capitalized like normal.

## Linking
If it is referenced on the page then it should be linked to. Small pages should link to the topic only once, no matter how many times it appears. Longer pages should link twice or three times depending on its length.

Red links are an idea ~~stolen~~ borrowed from another wiki. Red links might show instead of a blue one. Red links are used to prompt someone to contribute to that page. If it's not finished, or not worked on at all, that's when a red link should be used.

### Hashtags
The # will not be used in a link unless it's intended to direct to a section on that page.

## Lists
Sub-items can be added to lists.
1. Do one
2. Do two
3. Do three
   1. Do three point one
   2. Do three point two

Bullets can also be used if the order of entries doesn't matter.

- One
- Two
- Three
    - This option
    - That option 

## Article Layout
Each page will have its own, unique layout. But each page should try and match as closely as possible to the others.

## Intro
The name of the page should be emboldened within the intro. It should not be any longer than a paragraph. Take this one from the NHSE page as an example:

> **NHSE** (New Horizons: Save Editor) is, as the name suggests, a save editor for New Horizons. It was made by Kurt ([kwsch](https://github.com/kwsch)), written in C#, and is the longest standing save editor for NH. [MyHorizons](https://github.com/Cuyler36/MyHorizons) by [Cuyler36](https://github.com/Cuyler36) was the only other one, however it has been discontinued. It allows you to change basically everything you could think of, from the amount of bells your character has, to even changing your island from a 1-star to a 3-star, when it’s VERY obvious that you don’t have that beautiful island to show it.

It contains basic info about the subject. Each page should attempt to create an intro.

# Naming 
## Page Names
All pages should be named respective of what the tool is called. In cases where something has multiple names, the most common should be used. For example, Poker is formally known as "ACNHPoker". Because it is instead referred to as "Poker", in most cases, it should be used, as Poker is the most common and recognizable.

# New Pages
Pages will generally describe a tool used to mod Animal Crossing. And when it's necessary, pages can be created for other things (such as a list of items, a firmware update, a game update etc). 

## Unknown info
In some cases you'll have all the information at hand, ready to be used to create a page. Sometimes you'll learn that you're unlucky, and don't. In this case, the information shouldn't be guesses. Inaccurate information can lead a reader to even more problems down the road. If you only remember certain things, then it should be stated that it is an approximation.
