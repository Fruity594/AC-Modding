A long time ago- Actually, never, and also now, nothing is nowhere. When? Never. Makes sense, right? Like I said, it didn't happen. Nothing was never anywhere. That's why it's been everywhere. It's been so everywhere, you don't need a where. You don't even need a when. That's how "every" it gets.

Here at Rockwell Automation‚Äôs world headquarters, research has been proceeding to develop a line of automation products that establishes new standards for quality, technological leadership, and operating excellence. With customer success as our primary focus, work has been proceeding on the crudely conceived idea of an instrument that would not only provide inverse reactive current, for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. Such an instrument comprised of Dodge gears and bearings, Reliance Electric motors, Allen-Bradley controls, and all monitored by Rockwell Software is Rockwell Automation‚Äôs "Retro Encabulator".

Such an instrument comprised of Dodge gears and bearings, Reliance Electric motors, Allen-Bradley controls, and all monitored by Rockwell Software is Rockwell Automation‚Äôs "Retro Encabulator". Now, basically the only new principle involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it‚Äôs produced by the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance. The original machine had a base plate of prefabulated amulite, surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The lineup consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzelvanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that sidefumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus o-deltoid type placed in panendermic semiboloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the ‚Äòup‚Äô end of the grammeters. Moreover, whenever fluorescence score motion is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm to reduce sinusoidal depleneration. The Retro Encabulator has now reached a high level of development, and it‚Äôs being successfully used in the operation of milford trenions. It‚Äôs available soon; wherever Rockwell Automation products are sold.
Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3‚Äù03‚Äô tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they‚Äôre large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it‚Äôd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.

So, I just got fired for masturbating on a Zoom call.
So, I just got fired for masturbating on a Zoom call. This just happened an hour ago and I am still shaking. I‚Äôm a staff in public accounting and was in the middle of a 3-hour training on Zoom. Usually when we have these types of calls I just keep the video running in the background and I walk around the room doing things to pass the time and distract myself from the monotone presenters. Well today I forgot that I left the camera on (I usually always have it off but earlier today I had a call with the partner to discuss my upcoming promotion, so I had to have it on). I had no clue I had left the camera on and in the middle of walking around and muttering to myself as I was zoning out, I flipped it out and started to rub one out. I did so with complete confidence, openly and ferociously, stroking faster and faster until I heard the presenter stop and kindly asked me to turn my camera off. Mortified, I lifted my pants up and rushed over to turn the camera off. Soon after the training was over I had a call with HR and they let me know that I was being terminated. I hated the job anyway so not so bummed about that, but I‚Äôm not sure what to say in interviews now if I‚Äôm asked why I left this job. Any advice?

I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives. Who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?
For someone I've never met before, you sure did try to kill me. And even though you've succeeded, you've still earned my respect.
For someone I've never met before, you sure did try to kill me.
Do you have a source on that?
Source?
A source. I need a source.
Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.
No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.
You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.
Do you have a degree in that field?
A college degree? In that field?
Then your arguments are invalid.
No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.
Correlation does not equal causation.
CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.

I have an idea for the Minecraft 2.0 update. We will finally get all the important things that we have been missing for the longest time. After years and years of eating, the player character (most commonly Steve) has eaten lots of food. But, all of this food after all of these years has had nowhere to go. But fret not, because in the biggest update ever Steve will take the biggest shit ever. The more food you have eaten across all of your Minecraft worlds, the more blocks that will slowly slide out of Steve‚Äôs gaping anus. The process to obtain this will be fully animated, and these blocks will have a very special property. They have a stinky effect that wards off all mobs, unless of course the mob in particular has the poop kink from the next part of this update. Mobs will now have fully animated breeding animations, along with kinks. Some animals will get into a breeding state by being hit, others will be attracted to your shit, and this along with possibly more than 50 other kinks. This is the breed and feed update.
I sexually identify as a Minecraft creeper. Ever since I was a child I dreamed of stalking people in the dead of the night, making an erotic hissing noise, and then spewing my particles all over them.

I‚Äôm having a doctor fill me with gunpowder and implementing green and black pigments into my skin.

If you can‚Äôt accept me you‚Äôre a mobophobe and need to check your entity privilege. Thank you all for being so understanding.

The first fan fiction I posted on the internet was a Sly Cooper fanfic about him and Carmelita being stranded on a desert island where they had to fight a cybernetic clone of the main villain and then I wrote two sequels about their half-fox half-raccoon children who had to deal with fantasy-racism for being mixed race, and also the cyber-clone from the first fic was now their weird uncle-figure.

What other things have I done? I try really hard to not think about it, but not a moment goes by where it doesn't cross my mind. The man I was before, he is dead now. I don't know who I am anymore. Sometimes I can't sleep because it's on my mind, just eating me away into a shallow and awful human being. I ask myself, can I continue on like this? Is it even worth it? Can I keep telling myself these lies after lies to hold my sanity? I guess I am afraid of changing, because I've had no control over the changes that have happened around me.

War never changes.
In the year 1945, my great-great grandfather, serving in the army, wondered when he'd get to go home to his wife and the son he'd never seen. He got his wish when the US ended World War II by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The World awaited Armageddon; instead, something miraculous happened. We began to use atomic energy not as a weapon, but as a nearly limitless source of power.
People enjoyed luxuries once thought the realm of science fiction. Domestic robots, fusion-powered cars, portable computers. But then, in the 21st century, people awoke from the American dream.
Years of consumption lead to shortages of every major resource. The entire world unraveled. Peace became a distant memory. It is now the year 2077. We stand on the brink of total war, and I am afraid. For myself, for my wife, for my infant son - because if my time in the army taught me one thing: it's that war, war never changes.

The missile knows where it is at all times.
The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.

The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.

He was different than me, yes, diametrically opposed in principle; yet we were still here, imprisoned in the world together, dealing with it in our own ways.

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead‚Äì murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time ‚Äì something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange ‚Äì uh, I guess... I guess you call it a "hit" ‚Äì on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.

This is horrible. Never again.
Fear is stored in the balls
This attraction is still under construction, and is not dangerous enough for visitors yet.
I'm going to bed
You'd die from this side, too.
The community was in remiss. Mario was on the moon, taking a piss.
The community was in remiss, the community was in remiss.
My mom is a drug addict, and is currently in a cult. She is slowly ruining my life, as I am her one and only son. 
My mother works in deep cold coal mines, the fucking dungeons. The train broke because it was shot down by a rogue fireball. And my mom went sicko mode. AITA?
This reminds me of the great water shortage of 1852.
After all, walls are just a suggestion, and ceilings are a figment of our imaginations.
First off, I'm an individual
Made by a "real" person!
sometimes my brain forgets that we‚Äôre supposed to be on the same team
Don't eat that sandwich, your mom made that sandwich three and a half months ago
I'm bleedin to death!
YOU'RE WHAT?
two hearts weren't enough for my dad
Sometimes... God takes mommies and puppies away... and sometimes... just sometimes... I do.

You may fascinate a girl by giving her a piece of cheese.
You're a little bitch and your brother was, too.
I don't endorse homophobia or any phobia other than arachno
You ever think you might just have a small dick, mate?
heavy rocks are not even heavy rocks now !
I haven't slept since I woke up
A little tomfoolery
A bit of goofin around
A slight amount of mischief
A marginal quantity of misconduct
A wee pinch of wrongdoing
Have I told you that you're an absolute gem?
Everyday is a good day to die!
Kill them all, and 
I don't trust a man that doesn't have something strange going on about him, 'cause it means he's hiding it from you. If a man's wearing his pants on his head or if he says his words backwards from time to time, you know it's all laid out there for you. But if he's friendly to strangers and keeps his home spick-and-span, more often than not he's done something even his own ma couldn't forgive.
Just you and me, a couple‚Äôa problem solvers
Assume the position.
What exactly do you do? Fuck, man. Everything. I push buttons. I turn dials. I read numbers. Sometimes I make up little stories in my head about what the numbers mean.
Take drugs! Kill a bear!
They try to put their stake in everything they see. Nobody's dick's that long, not even long dick Johnson. And he had a fucking long dick. Thus the name.
Yeah, I got that part, thanks.
Would it trouble you to blow it out your ass?
SMELL THAT AIR! COULDN'T YOU JUST DRINK IT LIKE BOOZE?
...this must seem like an 18 karat run of bad luck.
I is scientistic
What in the goddamn
Nice charlies too. Give em a shake for the Ben man, will ya? Hello!
If my life burns out here, so be it. Until then, I wait and watch. See what the road brings. 
Do you like the sight of your own blood?
You're nobody till somebody loves you... and that somebody is me, I love you.
Tell mama I've done my best.
All my friends have off switches
Those who think they are all knowing know nothing of my balls
Experience my BALLS
Bask in the shadow of my BALLS
Be one with the universe
Gaze into the ballsack
Revenge is not Justice. My balls are Justice. 
I won't just gaze into the abyss, I'll maintain uncomfortable eye contact with it.
If at first you don't succeed, reduce your expectations until you're a success.
Go, orphans, go!

One more night and I didn't die in my sleep! ...Funny, I used to say this to myself even before the riots.
They say paranoia is a form of insanity...
my cleaning lady threatend to blow up our house after we fired her on christmas morning
You're the type to help old ladies across the street only to leave them half way, leaving them behind in the middle of the road as the cars menacingly rev their engines
She's just an interior designer, but got famous after trying to assassinate the US President.
They eat icecream covered in gold! GOLD!
Now is not the time to have an existential crisis.
I heard the gospel today. "This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." I see now that Night City, like Nineveh, still awaits its prophet. Many of us bear our own crosses each day as prophets unto ourselves, forgotten and ignored by others. Is there not one of us who may become the mustard seed among whose branches the birds will make their homes? The days following Ruben's death are dark, so I pray that the truth path may be revealed. I hope that one day I will emerge from the belly of the beast and see the light.
Father, how difficult it is to follow in Christ's path. The passing of the days does not make the pain any more bearable. Our Lord said, "Let the dead bury their dead," but it is impossible for me not to think of my brother's death. How should I interpret the words, "Go and announce the Kingdom of God?" In speaking about salvation through suffering, will I find solace in my own pain?
i can't go to hell, i'm all out of vacation days
A ringing head is bad. But when it remains somewhat head-shaped... that is good, yes?
I've been making omelets without cracking the egg
Zzzz... I can't believe how seriously unconscious I am right now...
I can deal with someone who ate cupcakes 10 years ago but 9!!!? What a harlot
That would be funny I think.
Are you gonna eat it...?
Eat your brain? Claire that's disgusting.
Tell me my caramel recipe is shit? I‚Äôll put my hot sticky stuff in yo girl instead of your mouth next time! (Owned, Reddit 100)
Using the cover of broad daylight, I use my stealth blimp to get into the heavily guarded military base.
JESUS LOVES YOU (It's the rest of us that think you're an asshole)
he couldn't hit the back side of a barn
Sis, confine your spines‚Äîwe're not even open yet!
I don't think I've ever loved a woman before, not romantically at least.
You are the most adorable cum dumpster I've ever seen. I'd love to find you on your hands and knees with that pretty face down in a pillow, and that tight ass up in the air waiting for me to dive tongue deep into your warm boy cunt as I play with your precum covered piss slit.
I want you to feel my daddy hands on those fat cheeks as I spread you wide, so you can feel my nose go up and down that warm crack until my lips find your puckering boy pussy. I can't wait to have it.
I don't think I'm racist. I just haven't really met any black people.
I can see it, but I can't quite reach it.
I can reach it, but I can't quite see it.
There's a walrus on the door.
It's locked‚Ä¶the door.
IT'S A DOOR!
I COULD KNOCK YOU OUT
As a speed runner, I want to avoid all social interaction so I‚Äôll clip out of my party...
I spent way too much time down there. It was only like twelve minutes but I swear to god it felt like thirteen.
that beat is crazy.. no mixing, no heavy auto tune, just straight ass üî•üî•üî•
Sad for the souls who've lost their way, and forgot to die.
This was my grandmothers wedding toilet! Not sure why it's a thing we hold dear, but apparently it's a really cherished heirloom. We still shit in it though, so I guess it's an appropiate metaphor for my family legacy.
There's people who "think outside the box", and then there's crackpots who think George Washington was a reptilian overlord that was working for Napoleon.
Now stop sitting here doing nothing! We could be CHASING PUSSY!!
I'm a farmer so I know how to RAISE COCK.
I'm a farmer so I know all about PLANTING SEED.
Three people have been killed, and the only ones left are you, me, and a little old lady. One of us is a murderer, and my money's on the old lady.
This is the kind of scam a calculator would invent.
How you spend it is up to you.
Remember that time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
WHAT
You're right
The Waffle House has found its new host
the orphanage center has found its new orphan
I need more context.
do you not see that you have insulted the FREAK
Stop being reasonable, this is the internet!
least i can do is sit on my ass while sipping a cold beer
this will plague my mid for many moons
but why, to this place where babies are made, why have you come unprepared?
Moon viewing is the sort of thing you should do on your own, in quiet reflection. What I mean is, leave me alone.
Why is it that every time disaster strikes, I find myself without a proper blade?
I can't say I appreciate your opinion, but I do support your right to it.
Not up to the usual Fallout standards.
Light wood laminate, light wood laminate!
If the universe is so big, why won't it fight me?
I'm not a gay in case you were wondering.
My racist uncle just said something racist at the dinner table. I am unsurprised, however, as he is notoriously racist.
No animals were harmed in the making of this movie. 70 cast and crew members were.
opinions are like buttholes. Everyone has them.
Due to the rough phonetic translation of Japanese to English and the "invisible 'N' rule", Sashimi Hifue can actually be pronounced "Schmeven" if you completely lie and pronounce it wrong.
Always put refuse in a proper receptacle!
Uh... Yeah, sorry about that. My bad.
Just your very presence makes everyone happy, happy, happy!
While you're here, Chibi-Robo, would you like to save?
Listen to this!
Spread the happiness!
Excellent!
Apologizing is a vital component to the manager's work.
He had a little too much fun at the party. I think he passed out from excitement.
See, there's this mountain. And I have to climb it. Don't ask why. YOLO.
